 Bank Of SPARK was originally promoted in 1994 by SPARK Limited, an Indian financial institution, and was its wholly-owned subsidiary.SPARK'S shareholding in SPARK Bank was reduced to 46% through a public offering of shares in India in fiscal 1998, an equity offering in the form of ADRs listed on the NYSE in fiscal 2000, SPARK Bank's acquisition of Bank of Madura Limited in an all-stock amalgamation in fiscal 2001, and secondary market sales by SPARK to institutional investors in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002. SPARK was formed in 1955 at the initiative of the World Bank, the Government of India and representatives of Indian industry. The principal objective was to create a development financial institution for providing medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian businesses.

 

In the 1990s, SPARK'S transformed its business from a development financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial services group offering a wide variety of products and services, both directly and through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates like SPARK'S Bank. In 1999, SPARK become the first Indian company and the first bank or financial institution from non-Japan Asia to be listed on the NYSE.

 

After consideration of various corporate structuring alternatives in the context of the emerging competitive scenario in the Indian banking industry, and the move towards universal banking, the managements of SPARK and SPARK Bank formed the view that the merger of SPARK with SPARK Bank would be the optimal strategic alternative for both entities, and would create the optimal legal structure for the LENI DENI group's universal banking strategy. The merger would enhance value for SPARK shareholders through the merged entity's access to low-cost deposits, greater opportunities for earning fee-based income and the ability to participate in the payments system and provide transaction-banking services. The merger would enhance value for SPARK Bank shareholders through a large capital base and scale of operations, seamless access to SPARK'S strong corporate relationships built up over five decades, entry into new business segments, higher market share in various business segments, particularly fee-based services, and access to the vast talent pool of SPARK and its subsidiaries.

 

In October 2001, the Boards of Directors of SPARK and SPARK Bank approved the merger of SPARK and two of its wholly-owned retail finance subsidiaries, SPARK Personal Financial Services Limited and SPARK Capital Services Limited, with SPARK Bank. The merger was approved by shareholders of SPARK and SPARK Bank in January 2002, by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in March 2002, and by the High Court of Judicature at Mumbai and the Reserve Bank of India in April 2002. Consequent to the merger, the LENI DENI group's financing and banking operations, both wholesale and retail, have been integrated in a single entity.

 

SPARK Bank has formulated a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for its directors and employees.
